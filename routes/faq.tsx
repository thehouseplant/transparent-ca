        <span class="font-bold">What is Transparent California?</span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California provides comprehensive and easily searchable
        information on the compensation of public employees and retirees in
        California.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Complete and accurate information is necessary to increase public
        understanding of government and help decision makers, including elected
        officials and voters, make informed decisions.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">Who provides Transparent California?</span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California is provided by Nevada Policy as a public service.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Nevada Policy is a non-partisan think tank that focuses on, among other
        things, empowering citizens and elected officials with information they
        need to make informed public policy decisions.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California relies on the generous support of individuals. If
        you would like to help support this site and ensure it is continually
        updated, please consider making a donation today!
        <br class="mb-3" />
        If you would like to directly support data collection for an agency you
        have an interest in, you can help by sponsoring data collection for that
        agency, which puts their data collection into our highest priority.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          Why does a Nevada-based research organization care about California?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        NPRI has a strong interest in government transparency everywhere. It's
        likely most of the media organizations you use for information on a
        daily basis do not have headquarters in your area or even your state.
        The location of the office has nothing to do with the information being
        gathered and provided.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          Where does the information on Transparent California come from?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        The information on Transparent California comes directly from government
        agencies and is obtained through public records requests, per the
        California Public Records Act, California Government Code §§ 7920
        through 7931.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">When will the data be updated?</span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California staff makes over 2,500 public records request
        each year in order to obtain, format and upload the most current data.
        The California Public Records Act limits us to asking for only existing
        data, we cannot ask an agency to create new data or new reporting for
        us. Accordingly, we tie our request timing to a reporting schedule
        established by the State Controller's Office (SCO) Government
        Compensation in California deadline for reporting data. We know after
        this deadline they will have existing data responsive to our request.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        For most agencies that deadline is April 30th of the year following. For
        K-12 school districts that deadline is June 30th. For more on these
        requirements, click here.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Pension systems are not a part of that system, however their data
        collection schedule usually coincides with our municipality collection
        schedule, starting in April of the following year.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Once the appropriate deadline has passed, our collection effort begins.
        Making thousands of public records requests, following up when
        necessary, receiving and processing the data files can then take most of
        a year for the Transparent California team.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        If you would like to help support this effort, you can sponsor data
        collection for any agencies you have a specific interest in directly.
        Sponsored agencies take on the highest priority in our data collection
        efforts, meaning their data may be collected and posted significantly
        faster than they would be without sponsorship. Sponsors are credited for
        their support on the agencies page, but sponsorship can be done
        anonymously as well if preferred.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        To be notified when new data is uploaded for a specific agency, navigate
        to that agency's page and click on the "Subscribe to this agency" link
        located directly above the search box.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        You can also sign up to our mailing list, or follow our blog and Twitter
        accounts, or follow our Facebook page to keep up-to-date on the latest
        from Transparent California.

        Transparent California relies on the generous support of donors to help
        keep the site online and constantly updated. If you value the site and
        would like to see it continue, please consider making a tax-deductible
        donation today!
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Occasionally we have an agency who either refuses to provide information
        or does not respond to our requests. If that has happened in any year
        from 2020 onward, you will see a note in their page for that year
        indicating this. You are welcome to contact that agency and ask them why
        they are hiding their compensation information from the public, and
        encourage them to respond to our requests.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        In rare cases we find it necessary to file lawsuits to obtain data. We
        would rather not do that, our objective is simply to obtain data that is
        clearly defined by state law as subject to disclosure, however some
        agencies do not want to comply with their legal obligations and require
        legal action. For a compendium of such efforts with links to associated
        posts and news stories, click here!.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        As we all know, lawsuits are expensive, and if you would like to support
        such efforts please consider donating so we can do that when needed.

        <span class="font-bold">
          Why is it important for the public to be able to see government
          employee salaries, pensions and names?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        The public has a right to see this information, because government
        officials work for the public. As the California Public Records Act
        states, the Legislature “finds and declares that access to information
        concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and
        necessary right of every person in this state.”
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparency is necessary to prevent fraud, waste and abuse. Just as
        important, transparency is needed to provide citizens and policymakers
        the facts they need to make informed decisions about the numerous public
        policy issues involving government employee and retiree compensation.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          Are names and salaries permitted to be published?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Yes. The California Public Records Act requires the publication of
        public employee names and salary information. More information on the
        Act can be found here.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          Is it possible to remove a name from Transparent California?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        All information on Transparent California comes directly from public
        records request and is public information.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        It is the responsibility of payroll agencies to remove names on behalf
        of employees, such as undercover officers, whose need for privacy
        fulfills the exceptions set forth in California's public records act.
        Transparent California cooperates with payroll agencies in the event of
        mistaken inclusions, and only removes names based on receiving
        communications from payroll departments.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          Why do the Transparent California records for some names appear in
          Google search results, but not others?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California doesn’t control how search engines search and
        display results.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Employees with unusual names are more likely to come up at the top of an
        internet search. Employees with common names show up in search results,
        but their Transparent California record may not appear with a high
        search ranking.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          What is included in the pay and benefit categories on Transparent
          California?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California uses uniform pay categories to mirror the
        categories used by the reporting agencies as much as possible,
        particularly the categories required by the .State Controller’s Office
        standard template for reporting to them.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        For instance, the "Regular Pay" column is the amount reported under
        "Base pay," "Total regular pay," or any other nomenclature indicating it
        is based on the normal pay rate of the employee. The “Overtime pay”
        column reflects the values reported as "Overtime pay" by the respective
        agency.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        While some agencies report many additional forms of pay separately, the
        vast majority only provide two additional forms of pay categories:
        "Other pay" and "Lump sum pay." Transparent California's "Other pay"
        category is the sum of these two categories. "Lump sum pay" is usually
        one-time payments such as payouts for unused vacation and sick leave.
        "Other Pay" includes all forms of pay not reported in the previous
        categories and may include, among other things, bonuses, stipends,
        longevity pay, incentive pay, car allowances, etc.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California has no detail on what components of pay are
        included in “Other Pay” for a given agency. If you have such questions,
        we recommend you make a public records act request to the agency
        directly.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        "Total benefits" consists of the employer-paid cost of health, dental
        and vision medical insurance and retirement contributions only. No
        benefit costs paid by the employee themselves are included. The cost of
        benefits do not reflect monetary payments received by the employee but,
        instead, reflect the cost incurred by taxpayers associated with
        employer-provided health and retirement benefits.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        The total cost of the employee will be higher than the values reported
        here as there are associated statutory (i.e. legally required) costs,
        such as workman's compensation, state unemployment insurance, Medicare
        and Social Security, that we do not report as employee compensation.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        For pensions, all values reflect the actual monetary value of benefits
        received during the respective year reported.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California cannot verify the accuracy of the data we are
        given. Since this data is collected using legal public records requests
        we assume the agencies are responding with accurate data. If you feel
        your data is being reported inaccurately, see the FAQ below on this.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">What are pension debt payments?</span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        The cost associated with employer-provided retirement benefits is
        comprised of two components: the normal cost and the unfunded actuarial
        liability (debt) payment, often called the UAL.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        The normal cost is the amount the pension fund determines is necessary
        to pre-fund that employee's future benefit. But because this cost is
        calculated based on a series of projections about future events, they
        oftentimes end up being insufficient to fully fund the employee's
        promised benefit.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        When this happens, an unfunded liability (debt) is created. In order to
        pay this debt down, the annual retirement costs are increased
        accordingly.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Beginning in 2017, agencies belonging to the state pension fund
        (CalPERS) are only required to report the normal cost portion — which
        gives the erroneous impression that their annual costs have
        significantly declined.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        To ensure the full annual cost of employee compensation is reported, and
        to maintain parity with the reporting methods used by non-CalPERS
        agencies as well as all CalPERS agencies prior to 2017, Transparent
        California prorates these agencies’ pension debt payments across all
        employees, determined by that employee's percentage share of all
        retirement contributions by that agency for the year. This prorated
        value is reported under the "pension debt" column.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        The pension debt column does not appear for any agency prior to 2017, as
        that cost was already included by the reporting employer as part of
        their retirement costs.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Similarly, it does not appear for the agencies that continue to report
        their full retirement costs to Transparent California.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        More on Unfunded Actuarial Liabilities can be found here.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          The downloadable files for some agencies indicate whether an employee
          was full time or part time for that year, how is this calculated?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        We are not given actual full time/part time indicators by agencies,
        however most municipalities (cities, counties, state agencies, etc) give
        us salary ranges for each position. If the employee made less in base
        pay than the minimum for that position, the system assumes they did not
        work full time that year and marks them as part time ("PT") in the
        downloaded data files.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        This is only an indicator, and can be incorrect in some situations. For
        example, an employee who receives minimal base pay but substantail
        compensation in the form of overtime or "other" pay may be shown as part
        time even though they were full time.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Also, if an agency provides us with incorrect pay ranges or no pay range
        at all that may result in inaccurate information here.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          Why doesn’t the compensation amount on Transparent California match
          the amount I receive in my paycheck?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California lists an employee’s total compensation, including
        benefits like health insurance and pension payments, and an employee’s
        salary before any deductions for Social Security, Medicare, retirement,
        etc… are taken.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Moreover, the cost of benefits do not reflect monetary payments received
        by the employee but, instead, reflect the cost incurred by taxpayers
        associated with employer-provided health and retirement benefits.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        In addition, we rely upon each agency to give us accurate and complete
        information.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          Are the values reported monthly or annual amounts?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        All values are annual amounts for the respective year reported. Some
        agencies choose to report their data based on fiscal year (usually July
        through end of June the following year), some choose to report calendar
        year (January - December) but the values are always annual.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          What if I feel the data on the site for me is wrong?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        As described above, all the data we post on the site is "as obtained"
        using legal public records act requests. If you feel the data is
        incorrect, we recommend you go directly to the agency and request they
        investigate.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        If an agency contacts us and indicates they feel data they provided
        correctly was incorrectly posted on our site, we would be happy to work
        with them on getting this corrected.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        If you would like us to take that up with an agency, you are welcome to
        send us a copy of your W-2 for the period in question, redacted of any
        personally identifiable information (all we need is your name and pay
        values) and we will contact the agency directly with that question. If
        you are not willing to provide that proof, we are unable to pursue that
        for you.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          Why doesn’t Transparent California contain information on all
          government agencies, employees and retirees?
        </span>
        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California's efforts are powered by a small group of part
        time staff, attempting to obtain data on almost 5000 public agencies
        annually. We prioritize the largest agencies, and unfortunately often do
        not have the resources to request data from all possible agencies.
        Smaller agencies in particular may be missing from the data for some
        years, but rest assured our goal is to obtain every bit of data from
        every agency possible.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        If you would like to help support this effort, you can sponsor data
        collection for any agencies you have a specific interest in directly.
        Sponsored agencies take on the highest priority in our data collection
        efforts, meaning their data may be collected and posted significantly
        faster than they would be without sponsorship. Sponsors are credited for
        their support on the agencies page, but sponsorship can be done
        anonymously as well if preferred.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        If an agency you are interested in is missing from our records, keep in
        mind you are able to make the same request that we do by sending them a
        public records request asking for their compensation information.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        In addition, while most government agencies and officials have complied
        with Transparent California’s public records requests, some government
        officials are breaking the law by refusing to provide the requested
        public records.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        You can help Transparent California obtain the records by respectfully
        requesting that a government agency fulfill Transparent California’s
        public records request.
        <br class="mb-3" />
        At this time, Transparent California does not request, collect or post
        compensation information regarding federal agencies and their employees.
        <br class="mb-6" />
        <span class="font-bold">
          How do I contact someone I found on Transparent California?

        <br class="mb-3" />
        Transparent California does not maintain the contact information — email
        addresses, phone numbers, etc… — of those listed on the site. We have no
        way of getting in contact with anyone listed on Transparent California.
